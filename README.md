# 🤖 Vrushank RAG Chatbot

An intelligent **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot that answers questions using custom knowledge stored in MongoDB.

Built using **LangChain, Groq LLM, HuggingFace Embeddings, and Streamlit**, this project demonstrates a complete end-to-end GenAI pipeline.

An end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that delivers accurate, context-aware answers by leveraging custom knowledge stored in MongoDB. Built with LangChain, Groq LLM, and HuggingFace embeddings, it combines semantic search with high-speed inference to create a scalable and interactive GenAI application using Streamlit.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Semantic search using vector embeddings  
- 🧠 Context-aware responses with LLM  
- ⚡ Fast inference via Groq (GPT-OSS-120B)  
- 🗄️ MongoDB Atlas vector search integration  
- 💬 Interactive chatbot UI with chat history  
- 💡 Predefined smart suggestions  

---

## 🔄 Flow

1. User enters a query in Streamlit UI  
2. Query is converted into embedding  
3. MongoDB performs vector similarity search  
4. Top relevant documents are retrieved  
5. Context + query passed to LLM  
6. LLM generates final response
